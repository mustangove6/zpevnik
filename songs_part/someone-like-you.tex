\[G]I heard that you're \[Bm]settled down
That you \[Em]found a girl and you're \[C]married now
\[G]I heard that your \[Bm]dreams came true
Guess she \[Em]gave you things I didn't \[C]give to you
\[G]Old friend, why are you \[Bm]so shy?
Ain't like \[Em]you to hold back or \[C]hide from the light
I \[D]hate to turn up out of the \[Em]blue uninvited
But I \[C]couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd \[D]hoped you'd see my face and \[Em]that you'd be reminded
That for \[C]me it isn't over

You \[G]know how the \[Bm]time flies
Only \[Em]yesterday was the \[C]time of our lives
We were \[G]born and raised in a \[Bm]summer haze
Bound \[Em]by the surprise of our \[C]glory days
I \[D]hate to turn up out of the \[Em]blue uninvited
