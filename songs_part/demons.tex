\beginsong{Demons}[by=Imagine Dragons]\beginverse
When the d\[A]ays are cold
And the c\[E]ards all fold
And the s\[F\#mi]aints we see
Are all m\[D]ade of gold
When your d\[A]reams all fail
And the o\[E]nes we hail
Are the w\[F\#mi]orst of all
And the b\[D]lood’s run stale
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[A]   I want to hide the truth\[E]
I want to shelter you\[F\#mi]
But with the beast inside\[D]
There’s nowhere we can hide
\[A]  No matter what we breed\[E]
We still are made of greed\[F\#mi]
This is my kingdom come\[D]
This is my kingdom come
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[A]When you feel my heat\[E]
Look into my eyes\[F\#mi]
It's where my demons hide\[D]
It's where my demons hide\[A]
Don't get too close\[E]
It's dark inside\[F\#mi]
It's where my demons are\[D] 
It's where my demons are 
\endchorus
\beginverse
When the c\[A]urtain’s call
Is the l\[E]ast of all
When the l\[F\#mi]ights fade out
All the s\[D]inners crawl
So they d\[A]ug your grave
And the m\[E]asquerade
Will come c\[F\#mi]alling out
At the m\[D]ess you made
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[A]  Don’t want to let you down\[E]
But I am hell bound\[F\#mi]
Though this is all for you\[D]
Don’t want to hide the truth
\[A]  No matter what we breed\[E]
We still are made of greed\[F\#mi]
This is my kingdom come\[D]
This is my kingdom come
\endverse
\beginchorus  \endchorus
\beginverse
\[A]  They say it's what you make\[E]
I say it's up to fate\[F\#mi]
It's woven in my soul\[D]
I need to let you go
\[A]  Your eyes, they shine so bright\[E]
I want to save their light\[F\#mi]
I can't escape this n\[N.C.]ow
Unless you show me how
