\beginsong{Always Look on the Bright Side of Life}[by=Monty Python]\beginverse
Some \[Am7]things in life are \[C]bad
They can \[G]really make you \[Em]mad
\[Am7]Other things just \[D7]make you\[Am7] swear an\[G]d curse.
When you're \[Am7]chewing on life's \[C]gristle
Don't \[G]grumble, give a \[Em]whistle
And \[Am7]this'll help things turn out for the \[D7]best... And...
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[G]Always \[Em]look on the \[Am7]bright \[D7]side of \[G]life\[Em]\[Am7]\[D7]
\[G]Always \[Em]look on the \[Am7]bright \[D7]side of \[G]life\[Em]\[Am7]\[D7]
\endchorus
\beginverse
When \[Am7]life seems jolly \[D7]rotten, There's so\[G]mething you've for\[Em]gotten
and t\[Am7]hat's to laugh and s\[D7]mile and dance and s\[G]ing. 
When you're \[Am7]feeling in the d\[D7]umps, d\[G]on't be silly c\[Em]humps
Just \[Am7]purse your lips and whistle, that's the t\[D7]hing! So...
\endverse
\beginverse
'Cause \[Am7]life is quite ab\[D7]surd and \[G]Death's the final \[Em]word
You must \[Am7]always face the \[D7]curtain with a b\[G]ow
\[Am7]Forget about your s\[D7]cene; give the a\[G]udience a \[Em]grin
\[Am7]Enjoy it, it's your last chance for the h\[D7]our. And...
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[G]Always \[Em]look on the \[Am7]bright \[D7]side of d\[G]eath\[Em]\[Am7]\[D7]
\[G]Just be\[Em]fore you \[Am7]draw your t\[D7]erminal \[G]breath.\[Em]\[Am7]\[D7]
\endchorus
\beginverse
L\[Am7]ife's a piece of \[D7]shit \[G]when you look at \[Em]it
L\[Am7]ife's a laugh and d\[D7]eath's a joke, it's t\[G]rue.
Y\[Am7]ou'll see it's all a s\[D7]how, keep 'em l\[G]aughing as you \[Em]go
Just rem\[Am7]ember that the last laugh is on \[D7]you, And...
