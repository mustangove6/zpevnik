\beginsong{Toss a coin to your witcher}
\beginverse
\[Am]When a humble \[D]bard
Graced a ride \[Dmi]along
With Geralt of \[Emi]Rivia
Along came this \[Dsus2]song \[Em]\[E]
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Ami]From when the White Wolf \[D]fought
A silver-tongued \[Dmi]devil
His army of \[G]elves
At his hooves did they \[D]revel\[G]\[E]
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Ami]They came after \[D]me
With masterful de\[Dmi]ceit
Broke down my \[G]lute
And they \[E]kicked in my \[Ami]teeth
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Ami]While the devil’s \[D]horns
Minced our tender \[Dmi]meat
And so cried the \[G]Witcher
He can’t be \[Esus4]bleat\[E]
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[Ami]Toss a \[E]coin to your \[C]Witcher
O’ \[D]Valley of \[Ami]Plenty
O’ \[D]Valley of \[Ami]Plenty
\[Ami] Oh, oh, oh
\[Ami]Toss a \[E]coin to your \[C]Witcher
O’ \[D]Valley of \[Esus4]Plenty\[E]
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Ami]At the edge of the \[D]world
Fight the mighty \[F]horde
That bashes and \[G]breaks you
And brings you to \[D]mourn\[G]\[E] 
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Ami]He thrust every \[D]elf
Far back on the \[F]shelf
High up on the \[G]mountain
From whence it \[D]came\[G]\[E] 
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Ami]He wiped out your \[D]pest
Got kicked in his \[F]chest
He’s a friend of hu\[G]manity
So give him the \[Esus4]rest\[E]
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Ami]That’s my epic \[D]tale
Our champion pre\[F]vailed
Defeated the \[G]villain
Now pour him some \[Esus4]ale\[E]
\endverse
\beginchorus (4x)
\[Ami]Toss a \[E]coin to your \[C]Witcher
O’ \[D]Valley of \[Ami]Plenty
O’ \[D]Valley of \[Ami]Plenty
\[Ami] Oh, oh, oh
\[Ami]Toss a \[E]coin to your \[C]Witcher
A \[D]friend of hu\[Esus4]manity\[E]  
\endchorus
