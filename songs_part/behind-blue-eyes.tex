\beginverse
\[Emi]No one knows what it's \[G]like
To be the \[Dsus2]bad man
To be the \[Cadd9]sad man
Be\[Asus2]hind blue eyes

And ^no one knows what it's ^like
To be ^hated, to be ^fated
To telling ^only lies
\endverse
\beginchorus
But my \[C]dreams\[D] they aren't as \[G]empty
As my \[C]conscience \[D]seems to \[E]be
I have \[Hmi]hours, only lone\[C]ly
My love is \[D]vengeance
That's never \[A]free
\endchorus
\beginverse
^No one knows what it's ^like
To feel these ^feelings like ^I do,
And I blame ^you!
\endverse
\beginchorus \endchorus
\beginverse
^No one knows what it's ^like
To be mis^treated, to be ^defeated
Be^hind blue eyes
\endverse
\beginverse
^No one knows how to ^say
That they're ^sorry and don't ^worry
I'm not ^telling lies
