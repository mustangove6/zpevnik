\beginverse
\[Em]I used to \[C]rule the \[D]world 
Seas would \[G]rise when I gave the \[Em]word 
Now in the morning I \[C]sleep al\[D]one 
Sweep the \[G]streets I used to \[Em]own
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Em]I used to\[C] roll the \[D]dice 
Feel the f\[G]ear in my enemy's \[Em]eyes 
Listen as the \[C]crowd would s\[D]ing: 
"Now the o\[G]ld king is dead! L\[Em]ong live the king!"
On\[Em]e minute I \[C]held the \[D]key 
And I discovered that my c\[C]astles st\[D]and 
Upon \[G]pillars of salt and p\[Em]illars of sand 
\endverse
\beginchorus
I \[C]hear Jerusalem \[D]bells are ringing 
\[G]Roman Cavalry \[Em]choirs are singing 
\[C]Be my mirror, my \[D]sword, and shield 
My \[G]missionaries in a \[Em]foreign field 
\[C]For some reason I \[D]can't explain
\[G]Once you go there was \[Em]never, never an \[C]honest \[D]word
That was \[G]when I ruled the\[Em] world 
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Em]It was the wicked and\[C] wild \[D]wind 
Blew down the \[G]doors to let me \[Em]in. 
Shattered windows and the \[C]sound of \[D]drums 
People \[G]couldn't believe what\[Em] I'd become
\[Em]Revolutio\[C]naries \[D]wait 
For my h\[G]ead on a silver \[Em]plate 
Just a puppet on a \[C]lonely \[D]string
Oh \[G]who would ever want to be \[Em]king? 
\endverse
