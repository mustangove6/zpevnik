\beginsong{Call Me Maybe}[by=Carly Rae Jepsen]\beginverse
\[G]I threw a wish in the well,
\[Em] Don't ask me, I'll never tell
\[C]I looked to you as it fell,
\[D]and now you're in my way
\[G]I trade my soul for a wish,
\[Em]pennies and dimes for a kiss
\[C]I wasn't looking for this,
\[D]but now you're in my way
\[G]Your stare was holdin', Ripped jea\[Em]ns, skin was showin'
\[C]Hot night, wind was blowin'
\[D]Where you think you're going, baby?
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[G]Hey, I just met you,
\[Em]and this is crazy,
\[C]but here's my number,
\[D]so call me, maybe?
\[G] It's hard to look right,
\[Em]at you baaaabeh,
\[C]but here's my number,
\[D]so call me, maybe?
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[G]You took your time with the call,
\[Em]I took no time with the fall
\[C]You gave me nothing at all,
\[D]but still, you're in my way
\[G]I beg, and borrow and steal
\[Em]Have foresight and it's real
\[C]I didn't know I would feel it,
\[D]but it's in my way
\[G]Your stare was holdin', Ripped jea\[Em]ns, skin was showin'
\[C]Hot not, wind was blowin'
\[D]Where you think you're going, baby?

\beginverse*
\[G]Before you came into my life
\[Em]I missed you so bad
\[C]I missed you so bad
\[D]I missed you so, so bad
\[G]Before you came into my life
\[Em]I missed you so bad
\[C]And you should know that
\[D]I missed you so, so bad
