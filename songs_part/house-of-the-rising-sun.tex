\beginverse
My ^mother ^was a ^tailor^ 
She ^sewed my ^new blue ^jeans
My ^father ^was a ^gambling ^man
^Down in ^New Or^leans.       
\endverse
\beginverse
Now the ^only ^thing a ^gambler ^needs
Is a ^suitcase ^and a ^trunk
And the ^only ^time, he's ^satisfied^, 
Is  ^when he's ^on a ^drunk          
\endverse
\beginverse
O, ^mother, ^tell your ^children
Not to ^do what ^I have ^done
^Spend your ^lives in ^sin and mise^sry
In the ^House of ^Rising ^Sun 
\endverse
\beginverse
Well, ^I got ^one foot ^on the plat^form
The ^other ^foot on the ^train
I'm ^going ^back to ^New Or^leans
To ^wear that ^ball and ^chain
\endverse
\beginverse
Well, ^there is a ^house in ^New Or^leans 
They ^call the ^Rising ^Sun
And it's ^been the ^ruin of ^many a poor ^boy
And ^God, I ^know, I'm ^one
