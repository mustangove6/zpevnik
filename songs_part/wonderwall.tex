^Backbeat, the ^word is on the street
that the ^fire in your heart is ^out.

\beginchorus
And \[Cadd9]all the roads we \[D]have to walk are \[Emi]winding
and \[Cadd9]all the lights that \[D]lead us there are \[Emi]blinding.
\[Cadd9]There are many \[D]things that I would \[G]like to \[G/F#]say to \[Emi]you,
but I don't know \[A7sus4]how.

Because \[Cadd9]maybe \[Em7] \[G]you're \[Em7]gonna be the one that
\[Cadd9]saves me\[Em7] \[G]and \[Em7]after \[Cadd9]all,\[Em7] \[G]
you're my \[Em7]wonder\[Cadd9]wall. \[Em7] \[G] \[Em7]
