\beginsong{All star}[by=Smash Mouth]
\beginverse
Some\[G]body once \[Ami]told me 
the \[C]world is gonna \[D]roll me
I \[G]ain't the sharpest \[Ami]tool in the \[C]shed  \[D]
She was \[G]looking kind of \[Ami]dumb 
with her \[C]finger and her \[D]thumb
In the \[G]shape of an \[Ami]L on her \[C]forehead  \[D]
\endverse
\beginverse
Well, the ^years start coming 
and they ^don't stop coming
^Fed to the rules and I ^hit the ground running
^Didn't make sense not to ^live for fun
Your ^brain gets smart but your ^head gets dumb
^So much to do, so ^much to see
So what's ^wrong with taking the ^backstreets?
You'll ^never know if you don't ^go
You'll ^never shine if you don't ^glow
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[G]Hey now, you're an \[C]all star
Get your \[A7]game on, g\[C]o play
\[G]Hey now, you're a \[C]rock star
Get the \[A7]show on, ge\[C]t paid
\[G]And all that \[C]glitters is \[A7]gold
\[C]Only shooting \[G]stars \[F]break the \[C]mold
\endchorus
\beginverse
It's a ^cool place, and they ^say it gets colder
You're ^bundled up now, wait 't^il you get older
But the ^meteor men beg to ^differ
Judging by the ^hole in the satellite ^picture

The ice we ^skate is getting pretty ^thin
The water's getting ^warm 
so you might as well ^swim
My world's on ^fire, how 'bout ^yours?
That's the way I ^like it and I'll never get ^bored
\endverse
\beginchorus  \endchorus
\beginverse
Some^body once ^asked
Could I ^spare some change for ^gas?
"I need to ^get myself a^way from this ^place " ^

I said, ^"Yep, what a ^concept
I could ^use a little fuel ^myself
And we could ^all use a ^little ^change " ^

Well, the ^years start coming 
and they ^don't stop coming
^Fed to the rules and I ^hit the ground running
^Didn't make sense not to ^live for fun
Your ^brain gets smart but your ^head gets dumb

^So much to do, so ^much to see
So what's ^wrong with taking the ^backstreets?
You'll ^never know if you don't ^go (go!)
You'll ^never shine if you don't ^glow
