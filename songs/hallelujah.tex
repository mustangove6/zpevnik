\beginsong{Hallelujah}[by=Leonard Cohen]\beginverse
Now I've \[G]heard there was a se\[Em]cret chord
That \[G]David played, and it pl\[Em]eased the Lord
But \[C]you don't really \[D]care for music, do y\[G]ou?\[D]
It \[G]goes like this the \[C]fourth, the \[D]fifth
The \[Em]minor fall, the \[C]major lift
The \[D]baffled king com\[H]posing Halle\[Em]lujah
Halle\[C]lujah, Halle\[Em]lujah, Halle\[C]lujah, Halle\[G]lu-\[D]u-\[G]jah\[D]
\endverse
\beginverse
Your \[G]faith was strong, but you \[Em]needed proof
You \[G]saw her bathing \[Em]on the roof
Her \[C]beauty and the \[D]moonlight over\[G]threw ya\[D]
She \[G]tied you to a \[C]kitchen \[D]chair
She \[Em]broke your throne, and she \[C]cut your hair
And \[D]from your lips she \[H]drew the Halle\[Em]lujah
Halle\[C]lujah, Halle\[Em]lujah, Halle\[C]lujah, Halle\[G]lu-\[D]u-\[G]jah\[D]
\endverse
\beginverse
You \[G]say I took the \[Em]name in vain
\[G]I don't even \[Em]know the name
But \[C]if I did, well \[D]really, what's it \[G]to ya?\[D]
There's a \[G]blaze of light in \[C]every \[D]word
It \[Em]doesn't matter \[C]which you heard
The \[D]holy or the \[H]broken Halle\[Em]lujah
Halle\[C]lujah, Halle\[Em]lujah, Halle\[C]lujah, Halle\[G]lu-\[D]u-\[G]jah\[D]
\endverse
\beginverse
I \[G]did my best, it \[Em]wasn't much
I \[G]couldn't feel, so I \[Em]tried to touch
I've \[C]told the truth, I \[D]didn't come to fool y\[G]a\[D]
And \[G]even though it \[C]all went \[D]wrong
I'll \[Em]stand before the \[C]Lord of Song
With \[D]nothing on my \[H]tongue but Halle\[Em]lujah
Halle\[C]lujah, Halle\[Em]lujah, Halle\[C]lujah, Halle\[G]lu\[D]jah (4x)
