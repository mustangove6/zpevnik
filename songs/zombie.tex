\beginsong{Zombie}[by=The Cranberries]
\beginverse*
\[Emi]Another h\[C]ead hangs lowly,
\[G]child is slowly ta\[D]ken
\[Emi]And the violence,\[C]caused such silence,
\[G]who are we mista\[D]ken?
But you \[Emi]see, it's not me, It's not \[C]my family
In your \[G]head, in your head, they are fig\[D]hting
With their \[Emi]tanks, and their bombs and their \[C]bombs, and their guns
In your he\[G]ad, in your head they are cry\[D]ing
\endverse
\beginchorus
In your \[Emi]head, in your \[C]head, 
zombie\[G], zombie, zomb\[D]ie-ie-ie
What's in your \[Emi]head, in your \[C]head, 
zombie\[G], zombie, zombi\[D]e-ie-ie, oh

^Another mo^ther's breaking
hea^rt is taking ov^er
^When the violence ^causes silence,
^we must be mista^ken
It's the ^same old theme since ^nineteen-sixteen
In your ^head, in your head, they're still figh^ting
With their ^tanks, and their bombs and their ^bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dy^ing
