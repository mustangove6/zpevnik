\beginsong{We Are Young}[by=Fun.]
\beginverse*
\[C]Give me a second I 
I need to get my story straight
\[Am]My friends are in the bathroom
getting higher than the empire state
\[Dm]my lover she's waiting for me
just across the bar
My seats been \[F]taken by some sunglasses
\[G]asking 'bout a scar and
\[C]I know I gave it to you months ago
\[Am]I know you're trying to forget
but bet\[Dm]ween the drinks and subtle things
the holes in my apologies
you know \[F]I'm trying hard to take\[G] it back
\endverse
\beginverse*
so if by the \[Dm]time the bar \[Em]closes
and you \[Dm]feel like \[G]falling d\[F]own
I'll \[F]carry you \[G]home 
\endverse\beginchorus
\[C]Tonight
\[C]We are you\[Am]ng
So let's set the world on \[F]fire
We can burn brighter 
than the \[G]sun
\rep{2}
\endchorus
\beginverse*
Now I \[C]know that I'm not
all that you got
I \[Am]guess that I
I just thought maybe we could find a ways to fall apart\[Dm]
But are friends in back
So let's raise a cup
\[F]Cause I found someone to \[G]carry me home 
\endverse

Just c\[F/A]arry me home to\[G]night
\[C]The world is on my side
\[F]I have no reason to run
\[C]So will someone come and car\[G]ry me home tonight

\[F]but I can hear the choir
\[C]so will someone come and ca\[G]rry me home
