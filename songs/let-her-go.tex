\[Am]Staring at the bottom of your \[F]glass
Hoping o\[G]ne day you will make a dream \[Em]last
The dreams come\[Am] slow and they go\[F] so fast\[G]

\[Am]Staring at the ceiling in the \[F]dark
Same old \[G]empty feeling in your \[Em]heart
Love comes \[Am]slow and it goes so\[F] fast\[G]
Well you \[Am]see her when you fall as\[F]leep
But to never to \[G]touch and never to \[Em]keep
Because you loved her too \[Am]much
And you dived too \[F]deep\[G]
