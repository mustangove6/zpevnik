\beginsong{Demons}[by=Imagine Dragons]\beginverse
When the d\[A]ays are cold
And the c\[E]ards all fold
And the s\[F#mi]aints we see
Are all m\[D]ade of gold
When your d\[A]reams all fail
And the o\[E]nes we hail
Are the w\[F#mi]orst of all
And the b\[D]lood’s run stale
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[A]I want to hide the truth
\[E]I want to shelter you
\[F#mi]But with the beast ins\[D]ide
There’s nowhere we can hide
\[A]No matter what we breed
\[E]We still are made of greed
\[F#mi]This is my kingdom come
\[D]This is my kingdom come
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[A]When you feel my he\[E]at
Look into my e\[F#mi]yes
It's where my demons hi\[D]de
It's where my demons hi\[A]de
Don't get too clo\[E]se
It's dark insi\[F#mi]de
It's where my demons \[D]are 
It's where my demons are 
\endchorus
\beginverse
When the c\[A]urtain’s call
Is the l\[E]ast of all
When the l\[F#mi]ights fade out
All the s\[D]inners crawl
So they d\[A]ug your grave
And the m\[E]asquerade
Will come c\[F#mi]alling out
At the m\[D]ess you made
\endverse
\beginverse*
\[A]Don’t want to let you do\[E]wn
But I am hell \[F#mi]bound
Though this is all for y\[D]ou
Don’t want to hide the tru\[A]th
No matter what we bre\[E]ed
We still are made of gre\[F#mi]ed
This is my kingdom co\[D]me
This is my kingdom come
\endverse
\beginchorus  \endchorus
\beginverse
\[A]They say it's what you ma\[E]ke
I say it's up to fa\[F#mi]te
It's woven in my so\[D]te
I need to let you go
\[A]Your eyes, they shine so bri\[E]ght
I want to save their lig\[F#mi]ht
I can't escape this n\[-]ow
Unless you show me how
