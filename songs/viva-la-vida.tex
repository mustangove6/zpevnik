\beginsong{Viva La Vida}[by=Coldplay]
\beginverse
\[Emi]I used to \[C]rule the \[D]world 
Seas would \[G]rise when I gave the \[Emi]word 
Now in the morning I \[C]sleep al\[D]one 
Sweep the \[G]streets I used to \[Emi]own
\endverse
\beginverse
I used to roll the dice 
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
Listen as the crowd would sing: 
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key 
And I discovered that my castles stand 
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 
\endverse
\beginchorus
I \[C]hear Jerusalem \[D]bells are ringing 
\[G]Roman Cavalry \[Emi]choirs are singing 
\[C]Be my mirror, my \[D]sword, and shield 
My \[G]missionaries in a \[Emi]foreign field 
\[C]For some reason I \[D]can't explain
\[G]Once you go there was \[Emi]never, never an \[C]honest \[D]word
That was \[G]when I ruled the\[Emi] world 
\endchorus
\beginverse
It was the wicked and wild wind 
Blew down the doors to let me in. 
Shattered windows and thesound of drums 
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait 
For my h]ead on a silver plate 
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king? 
\endverse
