\beginverse
\[Am]On the other side of a street I knew,\[F] stood a girl that looked like you 
\[C]I guess that's deja vu but\[G] I thought this can't be true cause 
\[Am]You moved to west L.A or \[F]New York or Santa Fe or 
\[C]Wherever to get away from \[G]me
\[Dm]Oh but that one night \[F]was more than just right
\[C]I didn't leave you \[G]cause I was all through 
\[Dm]Oh I was overwhelmed \[F]and frankly scared as hell 
\[C]Because I really \[E7]fell for you
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[F]Oh I swear to you \[C]I'll be there for you \[G]this is not a drive \[Am]by-i-\[G]i-i-\[F]i
\[F]Just a shy guy \[C]looking for a two-ply \[G]Hefty bag to hold my \[Am]i-i-\[G]i-i- lo\[F]ve 
\[F]When you move me \[C]everything is groovy \[G]they don't like it sue me 
\[Am]umm the way you \[G]do me 
\[F]Oh I swear to you \[C]I'll be there for you \[G]this is not a drive \[Em]by-i-i-i-\[Am]i
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Am]On the other side of a downward spiral,\[F] my love for you went viral 
\[C]And I loved you every mile \[G]you drove away 
\[Am]But now here you are again so \[F]let's skip the "how you been" and 
\[C]Get down to the more than fri\[G]ends at last
\[Dm]Oh but that one night \[F]is still the highlight 
\[C]I didn't leave you \[G]until I came to
\[Dm]And I was overwhelmed \[F]and frankly scared as hell 
\[C]Because I really \[E7]fell for you
\endverse

\beginverse*
\[Am]Please bel\[F]ieve that \[C]when I \[G]leave 
There's \[Am]nothing up my \[F]sleeve 
But love for \[G]you and a little time to get my head together too
\[Am]On the other side of a street I knew,\[F] stood a girl that looked like you 
\[C]I guess that's deja vu but\[G] I thought this can't be true cause
