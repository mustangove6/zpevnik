\beginverse
\[Hm7]Come up to me\[G]et you, tell you I'm sor\[D]ry
You don't know how lov\[Dsus2]ely you are
\[Hm7]I had to f\[G]ind you, tell you I ne\[D]ed you
Tell you I s\[Dsus2]et you apart
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Hm7]Tell me your s\[G]ecrets, ask me your que\[D]stions
Oh let's go ba\[Dsus2]ck to the start
\[Hm7]Running in ci\[G]rcles, coming up tai\[D]ls
Heads on a sci\[Dsus2]ence apart
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[G]Nobody said it was easy
\[D]It's such a sham\[Dsus2]e for us to part
\[G]Nobody said it was easy
\[D]No one ever sa\[Dsus2]id it would be this ha\[A]rd
\[A7]Oh take me back to the sta\[(D)]rt
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Hm7]I was just gu\[G]essing at numbers and fig\[D]ures
Pulling your puz\[Dsus2]zles apart
\[Hm7]Questions of sc\[G]ience, science and prog\[D]ress
Do not speak as lou\[Dsus2]d as my heart
\endverse
\beginverse
\[Hm7]Tell me you lo\[G]ve me, come back and ha\[D]unt me
Oh and I ru\[Dsus2]sh to the start
\[Hm7]Running in ci\[G]rcles, chasing our tai\[D]ls
Coming bac\[Dsus2]k as we are
