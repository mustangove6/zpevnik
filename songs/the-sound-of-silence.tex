\beginsong{The Sound of Silence}[by=Simon \& Garfunkel]
\beginverse
\[Ami]Hello darkness my old \[G]friend
I've come to talk with you \[Ami]again
Because a \[C]vision soft\[F]ly creep\[C]ing
Left his seeds while I \[F]was sleep\[C]ing
And the \[F]vision that was planted in my \[C]brain
Still re\[Ami]mains \[C]within the \[G]sound of \[Ami]silence.
\endverse
\beginverse
In restless dreams I walked a\[G]lone
Narrow streets of cobbled \[Ami]stone
'Neath the \[C]halo of \[F]a street \[C]lamp
I turned my collar to the \[F]cold and \[C]damp
When my \[F]eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon \[C]light
That split the \[Ami]night \[C]and touched the \[G]sound of \[Ami]silence.
\endverse
\beginverse
And in the naked light I \[G]saw
Ten thousand people maybe \[Ami]more
People \[C]talking with\[F]out speak\[C]ing
People hearing with\[F]out listen\[C]ing
People writing \[F]songs that voices never \[C]share 
And no one dare   \[Ami]     \[C]  disturb the \[G]sound of \[Ami]silence
\endverse
\beginverse
Fools said I you do not \[G]know
Silence like a cancer \[Ami]grow
Hear my \[C]words that I \[F]might teach \[C]you
Take my arm that I \[F]might reach \[C]you
But my \[F]words like silent raindrops \[C]fell
\[Ami]And \[C]echoed in the \[G]well of \[Ami]silence
\endverse
\beginverse
And the people bowed and \[G]prayed
To the neon god they \[Ami]made
And the \[C]sign flashed out \[F]its warn\[C]ing
In the words that it \[F]was form\[C]ing
And the sign said 
The \[F]words of the prophets are written on the subway \[C]walls
And tenement halls   \[Ami]and \[C]whispered in the \[G]sound of \[Ami]silence
\endverse
