\beginverse
\[G]I thought love was \[D]only true in \[G]fairy tales
\[G]Meant for someone \[D]else but not for \[D]me
\[C]Love was out to \[G]get me
\[C]That's the way it \[G]seemed
\[C]Disappointment \[G]haunted all of my \[D]dreams
\endverse
\beginchorus
Then I saw her \[G]face, \[C]now I'm a \[G]believer
\[C]Not a \[G]trace, \[C]of doubt in my \[G]mind
\[C]I'm in \[G]love, \[C]and I'm a bel\[G]iever
I couldn't \[F]leave her if I \[D]tried
\endchorus
\beginverse
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
The more I gave the less I got oh yeah
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine I got rain
