\[Ami]I was scared of \[G]dentists and the \[C]dark
\[Ami]I was scared of \[G]pretty girls and \brk \[C]starting conversations
Oh, \[Ami]all my \[G]friends are turning \[C]green
You're the \[Ami]magician's ass\[G]istant \brk in their \[C]dreAmis
\[Ami]Ooh, \[G]ooh, \[C]ooh 
\[Ami]Oo\[G]h and they \[C]come unstuck
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[Ami]Lady, \[G]running down to the \[C]riptide
Taken away to the \[Ami]dark side
\[G]I wanna be your \[C]left hand man
I \[Ami]love you \[G]when you're singing that \brk \[C]song and
I got a lump in my \[Ami]throat 'cause
\[G]You're gonna sing the words \[C]wrong
\endchorus
\beginverse
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and \brk heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
Oh, Oh and they come unstuck
