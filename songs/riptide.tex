\beginsong{Riptide}[by=Vance Joy]
\beginverse
\[Am]I was scared of \[G]dentists and the \[C]dark
\[Am]I was scared of \[G]pretty girls and \[C]starting conversations
Oh, \[Am]all my \[G]friends are turning \[C]green
You're the \[Am]magician's \[G]assistant in their \[C]dreams
\[Am]Ooh, \[G]ooh, \[C]ooh 
\[Am]Oo\[G]h and they \[C]come unstuck
\endverse
\beginchorus
\[Am]Lady, \[G]running down to the \[C]riptide
Taken away to the \[Am]dark side
\[G]I wanna be your \[C]left hand man
I \[Am]love you \[G]when you're singing that \[C]song and
I got a lump in my \[Am]throat 'cause
\[G]You're gonna sing the words \[C]wrong
\endchorus
\beginverse
\[Am]There's this movie \[G]that I think you'll\[C] like
This \[Am]guy decides to \[G]quit his job and \[C]heads to New York City
This \[Am]cowboy's \[G]running from him\[C]self
And \[Am]she's been living \[G]on the highest \[C]shelf
Oh
Oh and they come unstuck
\endverse
\beginchorus 3x
\endchorus
\beginverse*
\[Am]I just wanna, I just wanna \[G]know
\[C]If you're gonna, if you're gonna \[Fmaj7]stay
\[Am]I just gotta, I just gotta \[G]know
\[C]I can't have it, I can't have it \[Fmaj7]any other way
I \[Am]swear she's \[G]destined for the \[C]screen
\[Am]Closest thing to \[G]Michelle Pfeiffer \[C]that you've ever seen, oh
